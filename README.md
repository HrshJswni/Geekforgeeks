**Key Issues Identified:**

Difficulty visualizing complex concepts.

Accessibility issues for students with disabilities.

Inability to connect multiple VR devices to a single server.

**Expanded Explanation to Add:**

Traditional classroom learning lacks the immersive, hands-on experience necessary to fully understand complex subjects like DSA, mechanical operations, or emergency scenarios. This gap leads to poor retention and engagement, especially for students with disabilities or visual learners. Moreover, the lack of centralized VR control limits scalability in group learning.

**Process Flow**

The process flow outlines the full pipeline—from syllabus input to immersive delivery—ensuring every theoretical concept can be translated into an interactive, visual format. This modular design makes it adaptable to various academic subjects and industries.

You can use a heading like "Immersive Content Pipeline" in your PPT.

**Proposed Solution Overview**

Risk-free, cost-effective virtual training (for fields like construction, healthcare).

Immersive learning of complex academic subjects.
